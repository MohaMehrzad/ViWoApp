0) Purpose

A precise, implementation‑ready UI/UX specification for ViWoApp (Expo: iOS, Android, Web) that Cursor can follow to scaffold screens, components, theming, and interactions. The app blends a social feed (X‑like), short vertical videos, a DeFi hub, notifications, and messages. VCoin is the in‑app currency; users earn it for post engagement (like/share/repost). A persistent VCoin balance must be visible at the top‑right of the header across all tabs.

1) Information Architecture

Primary navigation (bottom tabs):

Feed (default) – timeline of posts (text + image/video/audio). Actions: Like, Share, Repost, Comment, Create.

Shorts – vertical, full‑bleed video feed with swipe up/down paging; inline actions.

DeFi – VCoin wallet overview and actions (Send, Receive, Stake). Transparency surfaces for fees/risks.

Notifications – activity (follows, mentions, rewards, system alerts).

Messages – 1:1 and group threads.

Global header:

Title: “ViWoApp” (centered on iOS; left‑aligned on Android/Web).

Right: VCoin Badge (VCN icon + numeric balance) → tap opens Wallet/DeFi.

Left: Optional avatar (opens Profile & Settings) in later phases.

Secondary navigation:

DeFi action sheets/modals; composer modal for new post; filter/sort menus on Feed.

Deep links: viwo://feed, viwo://shorts, viwo://defi, viwo://notifications, viwo://messages, viwo://wallet.

2) Design System

2.1 Tokens (light/dark aware)

Color

Background: #0B0F14 (dark default). Light mode: #F7FAFF.

Text Primary: dark #E6EEF8; light #0B0F14.

Text Secondary: dark #9FB0C3; light #3B4B5C.

Accent (interactive): #4DD0E1.

Success: #49E79A; Warning: #FFC857; Danger: #FF6B6B.

Glass Fill (overlay): rgba(255,255,255,0.06) (dark), rgba(255,255,255,0.4) (light).

Hairline Border: rgba(255,255,255,0.12) (dark), rgba(0,0,0,0.08) (light).

Spacing (dp): 6, 10, 16, 24, 32 (xs, sm, md, lg, xl).

Radius (dp): 10, 16, 24, 28 (sm, md, lg, xl). Use 28 for major cards (“Liquid Glass”).

Typography

iOS: SF Pro; Android/Web: Inter system stack fallback.

Scale (dp): 32/H1, 24/H2, 20/H3, 17/Body, 15/Body‑2, 13/Caption.

Line heights: H1 38, H2 30, H3 26, Body 22, Body‑2 20, Caption 16.

Elevation/Shadow (subtle, avoid heavy drop shadows on glass):

Soft: radius 12, opacity 0.25 (platform‑native shadow/elevation 6).

Motion

Durations: 150ms (micro), 220ms (default), 350ms (modal), 600ms (complex).

Easing: iOS‑like cubic‑bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1) for enter; (0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for material‑like harmony on Android.

Springs (tap feedback): mass 1, stiffness 400, damping 24.

Reduced motion: disable parallax/large blurs; prefer fades.

2.2 Liquid Glass (Apple‑inspired) – exact visual recipe

Goal: frosted, translucent surfaces that feel layered over dynamic backdrops, with crisp edges, vibrancy, and readable content.

Core layers (from back to front):

Background content (imagery/video/gradient).

Blur & saturation layer (simulated vibrancy):

iOS (UIKit analogy): UIBlurEffectStyle.systemUltraThinMaterial / materialDark.

Expo/React Native implementation:

expo-blur BlurView intensity: 28 (default); ramp to 36 on image‑heavy backdrops; drop to 20 on low‑end.

tint: "dark" in dark mode, "light" in light mode.

Apply a 1.08× saturation to the underlying scene (pseudo): when background is colorful, boost perceived vibrancy of foreground icons/text. In RN, approximate via a translucent gradient (see #Tech note below).

Glass fill overlay (to control luminance & readability):

Dark: rgba(255,255,255,0.06); Light: rgba(255,255,255,0.40).

Optional vertical subtle gradient: top +0.02 alpha vs bottom to add depth.

Hairline border (inner/outer mix for crispness):

1px border: dark rgba(255,255,255,0.12), light rgba(0,0,0,0.08).

Add a 1px inner highlight on the top edge: linear‑gradient to simulate bezel catch‑light.

Shape: 28dp corner radius (xl), no square corners on cards; maintain consistent rounding across glass surfaces.

Shadow: very soft ambient; avoid hard shadows (glass should sit close to content).

Noise/Dither (optional): a faint, tiling noise texture at 1–2% opacity can help break banding on gradients.

Readability rules:

Minimum contrast 4.5:1 for body text over glass; for small text/icons use 7:1 when feasible.

Add auto‑backdrop guard: if background luminance under card is high (e.g., white), raise glass fill alpha by +0.02; if very dark, reduce by −0.02 to avoid over‑darkening.

Performance fallbacks:

Devices failing perf budget (see §8) switch to opaque cards: #11161D (dark) / #FFFFFF (light), retain border + highlight; remove blur.

On Android WebViews and low‑end web, prefer CSS backdrop‑filter only when available; otherwise static color + translucency.

Tech note (Expo): When true vibrancy is unavailable, overlay a very faint saturation gradient atop the BlurView (transparent in center, lightly colored at edges) to emulate Apple’s material vibrancy without hurting contrast.

3) Layout & Grids

Safe areas respected; content gutters 16dp left/right on feed and lists.

Card vertical spacing: 16dp between posts.

Tap targets: minimum 44×44dp.

Bottom bar height: 56dp; icons 24dp with 10dp labels (if labels are enabled; default off for a clean look, relying on active icon + accessibility labels).

4) Components (specs & states)

4.1 Header

Title centered (iOS), left (Android/Web). Weight 700.

VCoin Badge (persistent, right): pill container on glass:

Height 28–32dp; horizontal padding 10–12dp.

Left icon: custom VCN glyph (or temporary Ionicons logo-bitcoin), size 16–18dp.

Label: “{balance} VCN”, bold 700.

Tap → open DeFi/Wallet screen.

Long‑press (optional): quick actions (Copy address, View rewards).

4.2 GlassCard

Props: elevated:boolean, padding:"sm|md|lg", interactive:boolean.

Default padding 16dp, radius 28dp, Blur intensity 28.

Border 1px, inner top highlight 1px.

Focus/hover (web): border alpha +0.04.

4.3 GlassButton

Pill shape radius 24dp; glass recipe with slightly higher overlay alpha for legibility.

States: default, pressed (scale 0.98, alpha +0.02), disabled (alpha −0.3).

Haptics: light impact on press; success tick for confirmed actions.

4.4 Feed Post Card

Regions: Header (avatar 32dp, author name bold 700, timestamp), Body (text; optional media), Actions row.

Actions: Like, Share, Repost, Comment.

Counters update with optimistic UI; on first engagement, show a +VCN toast (see §6).

Media: 16:9 for landscape; 4:5 portrait; full‑width within card; rounded corners inherit.

Overflow menu: Report, Mute, Copy link.

4.5 Shorts Player

Full‑bleed vertical player, snapping per screen.

Controls overlay (glass) on right: Like/Comment/Share/VCN earned.

Auto‑play with sound off; tap to toggle audio. Show subtle audio icon state.

Preload next/prev clip; maintain 60fps budget.

4.6 DeFi Wallet Card

Top balance (large 28dp text), currency VCN.

Primary actions row: Send, Receive, Stake (GlassButtons).

Secondary: View Rewards, Fees & Risks.

Below: transparency panel explaining rewards accrual and any fees (copy hooks, see §7).

4.7 Notifications Item

Title bold; body secondary. Reward notifications prefix with VCN icon.

Grouped by day; virtualized list.

4.8 Messages Thread Row

Avatar 40dp; name bold; last message secondary; timestamp right‑aligned.

New message dot as accent.

5) Navigation & States

Bottom Tabs: route IDs /feed, /shorts, /defi, /notifications, /messages.

Modals: composer, send/receive/stake, rewards breakdown, fees & risks.

Empty States:

Feed: “No posts yet.” + Create button.

Shorts: placeholder card explaining swipe.

Notifications/Messages: friendly empty copy + CTA.

Error States: banners on network failure with Retry; keep glass styling but increase contrast.

6) VCoin UX (earn & display)

Earning triggers: Like (+1), Share (+2), Repost (+3) [placeholder values].

Instant feedback: On action, show ephemeral VCN Gain Chip near the button:

Example: “+2 VCN” appears in a tiny glass pill, scales 0.9→1.0 (150ms), floats up 12dp then fades (600ms).

Balance update: Badge increments immediately (optimistic), reconcile on server response.

Rewards history: in DeFi → “View Rewards”. List entries with timestamp, source, amount.

Abuse controls (copy placeholder): “Engagement rewards may be capped or revoked for suspicious activity.”

7) Trust, Fees & Risks (transparency surfaces)

Before any on‑chain or wallet action, show a confirmation sheet (glass) with:

From/To, Amount (VCN), Estimated fee, Network, ETA.

Risk note: “Transactions are irreversible. Verify details.”

Primary CTA (Confirm) + Secondary (Cancel). Disable confirm until terms box checked on first use.

Fees & Risks modal: static explainer with accordions for: network fees, staking lockups, slashing risk (if any), reward calculations. Use Body text with 4.5:1 contrast.

8) Accessibility & Performance Budgets

A11y: WCAG AA minimum; dynamic type up to 120% without layout break; focus order logical; all interactive elements get accessible labels.

Motion: Respect OS “reduce motion”; replace scale/slide with fade.

Perf:

Target 60fps scrolling/feed; 30fps minimum under stress.

Glass fallback rule: if frame time > 22ms sustained for >1s, automatically disable blur (switch to opaque style) until next app start.

Video: limit simultaneous decodes to 1; prefetch next item only.

9) Platform Conventions

iOS: Title centered; tab bar translucent with backdrop blur; haptic feedback on tab change (light).

Android: Title left; Material ripple on taps; system back behavior obeyed; elevation slightly higher on opaque fallback.

Web: Use CSS backdrop-filter: blur(20px) when available; otherwise opaque fallback; hover styles for cards/buttons.

10) Cursor Deliverables (what to generate)

Expo Router skeleton with routes: / (tabs) /feed, /shorts, /defi, /notifications, /messages + global header.
